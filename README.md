The following c files are for ALX 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO project for the alx low level engineering curriculum, insideit contains the following implementation the opocoeds and Brianf*ck scripts:

* Implement the push and pall opcodes
* Implement the pint opcode
* Implement the pop opcode
* Implement the swap opcode
* Implement the add opcode
* Implement the nop opcode
* Implement the sub opcode
* Implement the div opcode

* Every good language comes with the capability of commenting. When the first non-space character of a line is #, treat this line as a comment (donâ€™t do anything)
* Implement the pchar opcode
* Implement the pstr opcode
* Implement the rotl opcode
* Implement the rotr opcode
* Implement the stack and queue opcodes
* Write a Brainf*ck script that prints School, followed by a new line
* Add two digits given by the user:
    -> Read the two digits from stdin, add them, and print the result
    -> The total of the two digits with be one digit-long (<10)
* Multiply two digits given by the user
    -> Read the two digits from stdin, multiply them, and print the result
    -> The result of the multiplication will be one digit-long (<10)
* Multiply two digits given by the user
    -> Read the two digits from stdin, multiply them, and print the result, followed by a new line
